A Linux-LVM compatible logical volume manager for mirage
========================================================

A logical volume manager allows you to group together multiple physical
disks (volumes) and treat them as a pool of disk blocks, from which you
can allocate multiple logical disks (volumes).

This implementation attempts to use the same on-disk format as Linux
LVM.
